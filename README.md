# UROP1100_Emotion_Recognition


The research aims to find a best algorithm to complete the real-time emotion recognition task on
the wearable devices such as mobile phone and google glasses. In this research, we first design
several machine learning emotion recognition algorithms based on some existing facial recognition
algorithm and test them on some famous emotion dataset such as CK+ and Yale dataset to find the
best algorithm. Then we try to implement it in android system to see whether it also works well in
real-time recognition.

### The Emotion folder contains the emotion labels of CK+ dataset

### The Landmark folder contains the emotion labels of CK+ dataset

### The Ipynb folder contains the code of testing the algorithm in CK+ dataset

### More information about the project and the designed algorithms can be found in the UROP1100_Report.pdf
